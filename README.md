Zack Overflow
=============

Welcome! This site is an overflow site in the style of Stack Overflow and it's related sites - but for all questions you may have related to Zack Mance.

This site is a demo app for Dev Bootcamp and was inherited from the great Matthew Huff, Mason Norsworthy, and Pat Torpey.

Running
-------
- Clone the repo and bundle install
- Create and migrate the database (don't forget to seed for demos)
- Create an account and create categories for questions
- Start posting and asking questions!

Users can comment on posts and upvote or downvote other user's comments - the top-voted comment will usually be the best answer...or at least the most common mistake everyone believes.

Misc
----
- Made in Rails 4
- Uses [skeleton], a lightweight css framework that provides an easy-to-use grid system for lightweight apps
- This app is meant to be fun, so keep it light!

Known Issues
------------
- Search is very specific and case sensitive
- Admin and category creation are yet to be fully implemented

Feel free to edit and improve as you see fit. Make changes and put in a pull request if you'd like to see your changes included.
